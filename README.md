# card-games
### by @forestctaylor

A Python-based repository containing resources for developing and playing single-player, command-line-based card games against artificially intelligent opponents. This repository is practice for future GUI-based card games for iPhone and Android.

## NOTES
* Relevant data structures (e.g. Card, Deck) stored in /basics.py
* Games organized into modules, runnable from the command line with commands like ```python holdem.py```

## SHORT-TERM TO-DO's
- [ ] Write single-player, command-line-based blackjack game
- [ ] Write single-player, command-line-based 5-card-draw game against user-specified number of opponents.
  - [ ] Write in difficulty levels: Not all players are experts, not all are novices.

## LONG-TERM TO-DO's
- [ ] Teach player-like computer to count cards
